# About
This project is a website where users can manage BestBuy and view BestBuy
products. 
This website calls the BestBuy API to seed and populate our database with
BestBuy product information. 
Users can make searches for specific products and filter their searches based on specific criteria such as price and reviews. 
Users will be able to view a search history page which will store the searches made by all users. 
Users will be able to retrieve information from the search history page, such as searches made in every country.
